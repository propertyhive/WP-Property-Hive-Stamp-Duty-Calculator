Users simply enter the purchase price then the stamp duty information is calculated instantly.

Note: This plugin is independent of Property Hive. You DO NOT need to be using Property Hive to download and use this plugin.

In the search field type “Property Hive Stamp Duty Calculator” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.
